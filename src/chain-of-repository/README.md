# Solving Complex Filters with the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in JavaScript

Imagine that the rules were on top of a super complex object, with many child objects nested.

Or even in a larger context, where we could receive a request for a service, having to trigger several complex and different rules, which can be constantly evolving by the business team?

With the Chain of Responsibility we were able to leave these rules isolated from lower-level implementations, maintainable, unit-testable, and open to extension.
